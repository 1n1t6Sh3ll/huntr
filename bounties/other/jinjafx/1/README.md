# :book: Description

`JinjaFx` is a Templating Tool that uses Jinja2 as the templating engine. It is written in Python and is extremely lightweight and hopefully simple - it doesn't require any Python modules that aren't in the base install, with the exception of jinja2 for obvious reasons, this package is vulnerable for `arbitaryCodeexecution`
